## Welcome to COVIDSG
COVIDSG is an Android application developed to provide information and monitoring of the COVID-19 situation globally. The app includes features such as statistical data and latest news globally, risk assessment tool, general information, and a search function. The aim of the app is to provide insight into the situation in an "All-In-One" solution. The app is currently only available for Android and can be downloaded [here](https://covidsg.app "COVIDSG | Mobile App")

### Development
The app was developed by integrating various third-party APIs for the statistical data and usage of CNA's news feed to provide the latest information. General information was obtained from crowd-sourced information in the [coronasafe](https://github.com/coronasafe/coronasafe.in "coronnasafe") repository provided by Github contributers. Lastly, the risk assessment tool was implemented using [Infermedica's COVID-19 Risk Assessment Tool](https://infermedica.com/covid19 "Infermedica COVID-19 Risk Assessment Tool").
